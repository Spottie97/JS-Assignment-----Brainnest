## TAKE NOTE
I have added Assignment 4 with a HTML and Javascript option as the "prompt()" function can't be run in Terminal and requires a Browser. Thus the HTML is for testing purposes.

## How to run the code
### VSCode
1. Open VSCode and navigate to the folder.

2. In VSCode, open the integrated terminal by clicking on View and then Integrated Terminal or by pressing Ctrl + `` ` (backtick).

3. In the terminal, navigate to the folder where your file is located using the cd command.

4. Run the following command in the terminal to execute the code: "node filename.js". Replace filename with the actual name of your file.
  
5. The results will be displayed in the terminal.

### Browser (For Assignment 4)
1. Navigate to the folder where the file it saved or has been downloaded.

2. Double-Click on the file and open it in your browsers of choice.

3. Now go to inspect elements/ developer tools so you can see the console.

4. The output will appear in the console.
